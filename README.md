### Project Description
National Commission for Human Development (NCHD) is a not for profit organization with the aim to transform lives of under-privileged countrymen by improving access to basic education and healthcare.  NCHD is the leading agency fighting illiteracy in 124 districts of Pakistan and helping people to find routes out of ignorance.

With a nationwide network of 101 Human Development Support Units situated all over Pakistan and hands-on-experience, NCHD aims at enlarging the scale and scope of the efforts made by the government in ensuring the effective provision of social services. It perceives human development as a process of enlarging choices, building capacities and encouraging participation of communities at the grass roots. To ensure this, NCHD is directed towards supporting government line departments, civil society organizations and the local communities in the sectors of education, basic health care and income generating activities at the grassroots. 

The project is to create a new Website using HTML version 5 and CSS3. Due to advanced interactivity and media support provided by HTML5, new functionalities can be easily added to the website.
